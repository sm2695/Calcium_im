# Calcium_imaging

Quick pipeline for processing 2p calcium imaging data from 2D (3D soon) neurons to process Asimenia's files. Set up using CaIman algorithm for motion correction and CNMF processing to obtain estimates and neuronal traces. 

Note: Computation and memory heavy steps, run on the server with a fat node.
